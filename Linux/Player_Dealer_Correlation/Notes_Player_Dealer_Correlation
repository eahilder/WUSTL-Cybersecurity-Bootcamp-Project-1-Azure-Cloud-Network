On April 4th, 2021, I, Eric Hilderbrand, was contacted by Lucky Duck Casino to review casino data on wins, losses, dealer schedules, and player analysis to determine if any potential theft had occurred. 

Viewing casino winnings and losses data for the dates of 3/10/21, 3/12/21, and 3/15/21, I observed 13 major losses throughout the day(s) on the roulette table. 

The times and dates of these losses are as follows:

a $82,348 loss occurred at 5am on 3/10/21.
a $97,383 loss occurred at 8am on 3/10/21.
a $82,348 loss occurred at 2pm on 3/10/21.
a $65,348 loss occurred at 8pm on 3/10/21.
a $88,383 loss occurred at 11pm on 3/10/21.

a $182,300 loss occurred at 5am on 3/12/21.
a $97,383 loss occurred at 8am on 3/12/21.
a $82,348 loss occurred at 2pm on 3/12/21.
a $65,792 loss occurred at 8pm on 3/12/21.
a $88,229 loss occurred at 11pm on 3/12/21.

a $82,844 loss occurred at 5am on 3/15/21.
a $97,001 loss occurred at 8am on 3/15/21.
a $182,419 loss occurred at 2pm on 3/15/21.

Cross referencing the players during all these major losses, I was able to determine that Mylie Schmidt had been a common player in all 13 of these games.

I also cross referenced the dealer scheduling for Lucky Duck Casino and determined that Billy Jones had been the dealer for all 13 major losses. 

Due to it being unlikely that the same dealer and player would be involved in 13 different roullette matches spanning over 3 days, that all ended in major losses for Lucky Duck Casino, I believe there is enough grounds to name Jones and Schmidt as potential suspects to theft and gaming violations.
